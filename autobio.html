    <h1>Autobiography of Kibet Amos</h1>

    <div class="chapter">
        <h2>Chapter 1: Early Beginnings</h2>
        <p>I was born on a cool, clear morning on May 7, 2000, in Kimugul village, nestled in the lush greenery of Bomet County, Bomet East Constituency. My parents, both dedicated and hardworking individuals, named me Kibet Amos. From my earliest days, they instilled in me the values of determination, honesty, and the importance of education—a foundation that would guide me throughout my life.</p>
        <p>
            My childhood in Kimugul was painted with the vibrant colors of rural life. The rolling hills, the fertile farmlands, and the melodious songs of birds were the backdrop of my early years. I was always drawn to the natural world around me, and my curiosity about how things worked began to bloom in this rich environment. The simplicity of village life fostered a sense of wonder in me, sparking an early interest in understanding the mechanics of the world.       </p>
        <p>
            
            As a young boy, I was fascinated by the way things functioned. Whether it was a simple farm tool or an old, discarded piece of machinery, I wanted to understand its inner workings. My parents recognized this curiosity and encouraged it, often bringing home small gadgets for me to disassemble and explore. These early experiences ignited a passion for technology that would later shape my career.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of my most vivid childhood memories is of the day when our village got its first television set. It was a black-and-white TV, and the entire village gathered around to watch the grainy images flicker on the screen. I was captivated—not just by the images themselves, but by the idea that a device could bring the world into our small village. From that moment on, I knew that I wanted to learn more about technology and how it could connect people and ideas..
